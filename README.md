# Maze-Generation-and-Solver-Platform
A Project written in Java which can generate and solve mazes, while also returning shortest path from start to end point, also has the ability to save mazes.

Generation of Mazes done by: Randomized Kruskal Algorithm
Solving done by: IDDFS, DFS, BFS, A* algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman Ford

Repository contains Node, Algorithm and Main classes and 3 sample mazes

Future Work: Wall Following Algorithm to be implmented
